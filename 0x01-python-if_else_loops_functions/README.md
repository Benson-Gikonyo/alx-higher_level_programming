0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions 

Task 0: Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

Task 1: Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number, and check whether it is greater than 5, is 0, is less than 6 and not 0

Task 2: Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. Use only onr loop, and only one print function.

Task 3: Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. As with Task 2. Print all the letters except q and e.

Task 4: Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal , as in task 2

Task 5: Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

Task 6: Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

Task 7:Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
    Prototype: def islower(c):

Task 8: Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

    Prototype: def uppercase(str):


Task 9: Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

    Prototype: def print_last_digit(number):
    Returns the value of the last digit
    You are not allowed to import any module

Task 10: Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

    Prototype: def add(a, b):

Task 11: Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

    Prototype: def pow(a, b):
    Returns the value of a ^ b

Task 12: Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

    For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz.
    For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
    Prototype: def fizzbuzz():
    Each element should be followed by a space

Task 13: Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.

    You can only use one print function with string format
    You can only use one loop in your code
