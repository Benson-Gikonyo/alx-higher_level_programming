The ``100-matrix_mul`` module
===============================
This module has the function ``def matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)``.

``matrix_mul`` function
===============================
This function multiplies 2 matrices:

Importing function from the module:
    >>> text_indentation = __import__('100-matrix_mul').matrix_mul


Testing m_a and m_b are both type lists

Testing m_a and m_b are both nested lists

m_a and m_b are not empty lists

all elements of m_a and m_b are types int or float

all rows of m_a are same size

all rows of m_b are same size

size of columns of m_a is equal to size of rows of m_b (possibility of multiplication)
