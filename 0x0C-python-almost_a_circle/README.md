Task 0: If it's not tested it doesn't work 


Task 1: Write the first class Base:

Task 2: Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base:

Task 3: Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation. 

Task 4: Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.

Task 5: Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you donâ€™t need to handle x and y here.

Task 6: Update the class Rectangle by overriding the __str__ method 

Task 7: Update the class Rectangle by improving the public method def display(self): to print in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # by taking care of x and y

Task 8: Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def update(self, *args): that assigns an argument to each attribute

Task 9: Update the class Rectangle by updating the public method def update(self, *args): by changing the prototype to update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns a key/value argument to attributes

Task 10: Write the class Square that inherits from Rectangle

Task 11: Update the class Square by adding the public method def update(self, *args, **kwargs)

Task 12: Update the class Square by adding the public method def update(self, *args, **kwargs)

Task 13: Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self)
